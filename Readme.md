**SRA** is an enterprise-grade, AI-orchestrated ecosystem designed to formalize the software requirements engineering lifecycle. By combining Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning with rigorous architectural standards, SRA transforms fragmented project visions into high-fidelity, production-ready technical specifications (IEEE-830).

## 🏛️ Executive Summary

In contemporary software development, **43% of project failures** are attributed to poor requirements gathering. **SRA** mitigates this risk by providing an automated, multi-layered validation and synthesis engine. It serves as the bridge between business objectives and technical execution, ensuring that every project starts with a cohesive, logical, and architecturally sound foundation.

### Core Value Propositions
*   **Zero-Ambiguity Intake**: Standardizes raw stakeholder descriptions into structured architectural models.
*   **AI-Driven Governance**: Real-time logic checking to identify contradictions, missing logic, and technical gaps.
*   **High-Fidelity Visuals**: Automated generation of multi-level Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) and system-level Mermaid diagrams.
*   **Semantic Intelligence**: Leverages vector-based knowledge retrieval (RAG) to ensure consistency across complex project portfolios.

## �️ The 5-Layer Analysis Pipeline

SRA operates on a proprietary 5-layer pipeline that ensures every requirement is processed through a rigid quality-control sequence.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "The SRA Pipeline"
    L1[<b>Layer 1: Strategic Intake</b><br/>Unstructured Input Mapping]
    L2[<b>Layer 2: Logic Validation</b><br/>AI-Gatekeeper Verification]
    L3[<b>Layer 3: Analysis & Synthesis</b><br/>IEEE SRS Generation]
    L4[<b>Layer 4: Iterative Refinement</b><br/>Live Workspace & Diff Tracking]
    L5[<b>Layer 5: Knowledge Persistence</b><br/>Semantic Indexing & Reuse]
    end

    Stakeholder((Stakeholder)) -->|Raw Vision| L1
    L1 --> L2
    L2 -->|FAIL: Ambiguity Detected| L1
    L2 -->|PASS| L3
    L3 --> L4
    L4 -->|Export| Artifacts[IEEE SRS, PDF, DFD, API Spec]
    L4 --> L5
```

### Layer Breakdown
1.  **Strategic Intake**: Translates free-text into a mapped JSON model aligned with IEEE section hierarchies.
2.  **Logic Validation**: A high-speed reasoning pass (Gatekeeper) that evaluates clarity, consistency, and detail sufficiency.
3.  **Analysis & Synthesis**: Heavy LLM processing to generate the full document, including User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, and Entity-Relationship maps.
4.  **Iterative Refinement**: A modular Workspace UI for manual adjustments, version branching, and intelligent diagram repair.
5.  **Knowledge Persistence**: Finalized requirements are "shredded" and indexed into a Vector Database for cross-project intelligence and RAG.

## 🛡️ Production Hardening

SRA is engineered for stability, security, and enterprise-grade performance.

### 🧩 Infrastructure Security
- **Multi-Stage Docker Builds**: Minimized production images using separate build/runtime environments.
- **Non-Root Execution**: Containers run as unprivileged users (`nodejs`/`nextjs`) to mitigate security risks.
- **Dependency Pinning**: Strict versioning of core dependencies (e.g., Next.js 16.1.6) to ensure environment parity.

### 🌐 Network & Content Security
- **Hardened CSP**: Strict Content Security Policy injected via Next.js and Express security headers.
- **HSTS & Frame Protection**: Production-grade `Strict-Transport-Security` and `X-Frame-Options` (DENY/SAMEORIGIN) enforcement.
- **Strict CSRF Enforcement**: Mandatory `CSRF_SECRET` validation in production to prevent insecure session fallbacks.
- **Privacy Sanitization**: Integrated `sanitizer.js` layer to prevent data leakage to LLM providers.
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent API throttling across auth, analysis, and worker endpoints.

### 🔍 Search & Performance Optimization
- **Automated SEO**: Dynamic `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` generation for search engine discoverability.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Native handling of `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` to ensure zero-downtime deployments and safe process termination.
- **Standalone Mode**: Next.js optimized standalone output for significantly faster boot times in containerized environments.
- **Smart Data Fetching**: SWR-based caching and background revalidation for optimal user experience.

### 🔐 Backup & Disaster Recovery
- **Automated Encrypted Backups**: Weekly automated database backups with AES-256-GCM encryption.
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: 7-day PITR via Supabase for granular data restoration.
- **CLI Backup Management**: Command-line tools for manual backup creation, restoration, and verification.
- **Multi-Location Storage**: Backups stored locally, in GitHub Artifacts, and Supabase snapshots.
- **Integrity Verification**: SHA-256 checksums ensure backup file integrity.

### 🛡️ Security Monitoring & Audit
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Tracks all sensitive operations (create, delete, export) with full metadata.
- **Threat Detection**: Real-time monitoring for brute force attempts, mass deletions, and unusual access patterns.
- **Field-Level Encryption**: PII data encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM.
- **Daily Security Audits**: Automated dependency scanning, secret leak detection, and security header validation.
- **Compliance Ready**: Audit trails and security reports for regulatory compliance.
