## 🛡️ Production Hardening

SRA is engineered for stability, security, and enterprise-grade performance.

### 🧩 Infrastructure Security
- **Multi-Stage Docker Builds**: Minimized production images using separate build/runtime environments.
- **Non-Root Execution**: Containers run as unprivileged users (`nodejs`/`nextjs`) to mitigate security risks.
- **Dependency Pinning**: Strict versioning of core dependencies (e.g., Next.js 16.1.6) to ensure environment parity.

### 🌐 Network & Content Security
- **Hardened CSP**: Strict Content Security Policy injected via Next.js and Express security headers.
- **HSTS & Frame Protection**: Production-grade `Strict-Transport-Security` and `X-Frame-Options` (DENY/SAMEORIGIN) enforcement.
- **Secure Session Management**: JWT-based authentication with secure cookie handling.
- **Privacy Sanitization**: Integrated `sanitizer.js` layer to prevent data leakage to LLM providers.
- **Distributed Rate Limiting**: Redis-backed throttling ensures global protection across all server instances.

### 🔍 AI Reliability & Performance optimization
- **AI Reliability Layer**: Implemented a standardized `BaseAgent` with a 6-minute timeout, jittered retries, and high-fidelity JSON parsing logs for stable long-form document generation.
- **Frontend Code Splitting**: Transitioned to an "Archive-First" dynamic loading strategy using `next/dynamic`. Components like `ResultsTabs` and their individual sub-tabs are lazy-loaded to minimize initial JS payload and improve TBT.
- **Redis Caching**: High-traffic endpoints (Dashboard) cached via Upstash for sub-millisecond retrieval.
- **Automated SEO**: Dynamic `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` generation for search engine discoverability.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Native handling of `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` to ensure zero-downtime deployments.
- **Standalone Mode**: Next.js optimized standalone output.
- **Smart Data Fetching**: SWR-based caching and background revalidation.

### 🔐 Backup & Disaster Recovery
- **Automated Encrypted Backups**: Weekly automated database backups with AES-256-GCM encryption.
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: 7-day PITR via Supabase for granular data restoration.
- **CLI Backup Management**: Command-line tools for manual backup creation, restoration, and verification.
- **Multi-Location Storage**: Backups stored locally, in GitHub Artifacts, and Supabase snapshots.
- **Integrity Verification**: SHA-256 checksums ensure backup file integrity.

### �️ Security Monitoring & Audit
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Tracks all sensitive operations (create, delete, export) with full metadata.
- **Threat Detection**: Real-time monitoring for brute force attempts, mass deletions, and unusual access patterns.
- **Field-Level Encryption**: PII data encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM.
- **Daily Security Audits**: Automated dependency scanning, secret leak detection, and security header validation.
- **Compliance Ready**: Audit trails and security reports for regulatory compliance.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code

SRA uses **Terraform** to manage cloud infrastructure declaratively, ensuring reproducibility, disaster recovery, and version-controlled infrastructure changes.

<details>
<summary><strong>🛠️ Click to Expand Terraform Details</strong></summary>

### Infrastructure Management

All infrastructure configuration is defined in the `terraform/` directory:

```bash
terraform/
├── main.tf                    # Provider & backend configuration
├── variables.tf               # Variable definitions
├── vercel.tf                  # Vercel project resources
├── outputs.tf                 # Output values
├── terraform.tfvars.example   # Configuration template
└── README.md                  # Detailed usage guide
```

### Managed Resources

Terraform manages the following infrastructure:
- ✅ **Vercel Projects**: Frontend (`sra`) and Backend (`sra-backend`)
- ✅ **Build Configuration**: Build/install commands and framework settings
- ✅ **Git Integration**: Repository connections and deployment triggers

**Note:** Environment variables are managed directly in Vercel dashboard to avoid storing secrets in Terraform state.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to terraform directory
cd terraform

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Preview infrastructure changes
terraform plan

# Apply changes (when ready)
terraform apply
```

### Benefits

- 🔄 **Version Control**: Infrastructure changes tracked in git
- 🛡️ **Disaster Recovery**: Rebuild entire infrastructure with one command
- 📝 **Documentation**: Infrastructure is self-documenting code
- 🔍 **Audit Trail**: Complete history of infrastructure changes
- 🤝 **Collaboration**: Team members can propose infrastructure changes via PRs

For detailed Terraform usage, see [`terraform/README.md`](./terraform/README.md).

### 2. Deployment Strategies

#### 🐳 Docker Orchestration (Recommended)
SRA is fully containerized for cloud-agnostic deployment. Our CI pipeline automatically publishes production-ready images to **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**.

```bash
# Pull and run the latest images
docker-compose up --build -d
```
*   **API Service**: `http://localhost:3000` (Optimized Multi-stage Build)
*   **Application UI**: `http://localhost:3001` (Next.js Standalone Build)
*   **Registry**: `ghcr.io/aniket-a14/sra-backend:latest`

#### 🛠️ CLI Toolkit (Production Ready)
The SRA CLI is the heart of the v4.0 workflow. Install it globally to sync your code with your specs:
```bash
npm install -g @aniket_a14/sra-cli
sra init
```

#### ⚒️ Manual Infrastructure Setup
For local development or specialized environments:
```bash
# Initialize Identity & Data
cd backend && npm install && npx prisma migrate dev

# Initialize Application Layer
cd ../frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

#### 🤖 Agentic & CI Workflows
SRA leverages professional GitHub Actions for continuous quality assurance:
*   **Publish Docker**: Automated image pushes to [GHCR](https://github.com/Aniket-a14/SRA/pkgs/container/sra-frontend).
*   **Bundle Size**: Continuous monitoring of Next.js JS payloads on every branch.
*   **Health Checks**: Hourly automated uptime verification of the entire pipeline.
